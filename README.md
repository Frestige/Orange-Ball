## Gameplay

- Jump by tapping the screen
- Continue, Restart or Quit via the pause menu
- Timer so as not to lose track of time (can be deactivated via the pause menu)


## Requirements

- Unity if you want to build your own files
- (iOS) Xcode to open the project files (only on mac)


## Usage

Download the files to build it on your own via Unity or use the pre builded versions in the "Builds" folder in the [release](https://github.com/Frestige/Orange-Ball/releases/tag/v1.4) folder.

If you build your own iOS files, don't forget to select the correct SDK (simulator or device) via player settings.

And if you use the device SDK version, make sure to download and import your [provisioning profiles](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/deva899b4fe5)


## Installation

(Pre-build) iOS: Download the [release](https://github.com/Frestige/Orange-Ball/releases/tag/v1.4), go to the "Builds" folder, select your version and open the Xcode project ("Unity-iPhone.xcodeproj"), select your Device / Simulator and hit run.

(NOTE: For whatever reason does Xcode connect to the internet when running the simulator - (the game is 100% offline) if you know a solution for this, [please let me know](https://x.com/maxim_lrn?s=21&t=lmH1howR24KPrWqYhTc3YQ))

(Pre-Build) Android: Open the .apk in the folder 

(Pre-Build) Windows: Open the .exe in the folder
